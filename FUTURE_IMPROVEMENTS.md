## 📊 Analytics & Measurable Outcomes

### Tracking Dashboard
We will track and publicly share:

- **Mastery rates**: Percentage of students achieving 90%+ competency vs. traditional grading
- **Time-to-competency**: How long it takes students to master concepts compared to age-based grade levels
- **Engagement metrics**: Time spent learning, lessons completed, test attempts
- **Demographic impact**: Success rates across income levels, geographic locations, and learning backgrounds
- **Open-source adoption**: Number of schools/educators using our curriculum materials

All data will be anonymized and published for education research purposes.
