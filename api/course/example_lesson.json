  "explanation": "## What is a Variable?\n\nA **variable** is a symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown or changing value. Think of it as a placeholder for a number we don't know yet.\n\n### Why Use Variables?\n\nVariables allow us to:\n- Write general rules and formulas\n- Solve problems where we don't know all the information\n- Express relationships between quantities\n\n### Algebraic Expressions\n\nAn **algebraic expression** combines variables, numbers, and operations (+, -, ×, ÷). For example:\n- `3x + 5` (three times x, plus five)\n- `2a - 7b` (two times a, minus seven times b)\n- `x² + 4x - 3` (x squared, plus four x, minus three)\n\n### Evaluating Expressions\n\nTo **evaluate** an expression means to find its value by substituting numbers for the variables.\n\nFor example, if `x = 4`, then:\n- `3x + 5 = 3(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17`\n\n### Key Terms\n\n- **Variable**: A letter representing an unknown value\n- **Coefficient**: The number multiplied by a variable (in `3x`, the coefficient is 3)\n- **Constant**: A value that doesn't change (in `3x + 5`, the constant is 5)\n- **Term**: A single part of an expression (in `3x + 5`, there are two terms: `3x` and `5`)",

We practiced writing and evaluating **algebraic expressions** by substituting numbers for variables. Remember to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) when evaluating: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction. Key concepts include understanding **coefficients** (numbers multiplied by variables), **constants** (fixed numbers), and **terms** (parts of an expression separated by + or - signs).",
